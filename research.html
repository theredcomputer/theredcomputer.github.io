                    <p>The explosive growth of technology over the last few decades has led to unseen transformations in the way our society operates. The key common thread running between these developments has been their immobile, nature, unable to physically manipulate the world in meaningful ways. However, advances in machine learning, algorithmic path planning, cost reductions, and more have allowed for robotics to hold a meaningful presence in the world. Developing robotic agents&mdash;capable of making the world and a desired state into a sequence of reasoned actions to achieve a particular goal&mdash;brings fresh sets of challenges for society at large. For example, knowing and understanding how these systems make decisions will be critical in developing trust. </p>

                    <p>My research seeks to approach this reality by considering the intersection between privacy and robotics. While some literature considering robotics from a privacy-focused standpoint exists, this space is still largely unexplored. A long-term goal is to bring formal privacy guarantees into the field of robotics. </p>

                    <p><a href="http://robots.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/papers/ijrr2018privatetracking.pdf">[Paper from first topic area]</a> + <a href="http://jvdb.org/papers/fse2017preprint.pdf">[Paper for second topic area]</a></p>
                    <p>The first paper discusses the "panda tracking" problem, where researchers track a panda using a robot. However, poachers can intercept position information about the panda. The goal, therefore, is to preserve the privacy of the panda to protect it from the poachers while still receiving useful location data. The second paper introduces Privacy-Enhanced Filtering (PEF), a framework for identifying privacy network traffic and transforming the information into a form which would not compromise privacy.</p>

                    <p>A research idea emerging from the consideration of these two papers would be the application of PEF to the network traffic coming from the panda-tracking robot. This may protect the privacy of the panda.</p>
