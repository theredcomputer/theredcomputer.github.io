                    <p>The explosive growth of technology over the last few decades has led to unseen transformations in the way our society operates. The key common thread running between these developments has been their immobile, nature, unable to physically manipulate the world in meaningful ways. However, advances in machine learning, algorithmic path planning, cost reductions, and more have allowed for robotics to hold a meaningful presence in the world. Developing robotic agents&mdash;capable of making the world and a desired state into a sequence of reasoned actions to achieve a particular goal&mdash;brings fresh sets of challenges for society at large. For example, knowing and understanding how these systems make decisions will be critical in developing trust. </p>

                    <p>My research seeks to approach this reality by considering the intersection between privacy and robotics. While some literature considering robotics from a privacy-focused standpoint exists, this space is still largely unexplored. A long-term goal is to bring formal privacy guarantees into the field of robotics.</p>
